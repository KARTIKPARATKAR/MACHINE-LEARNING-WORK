3 main piller of ML-
a)Data(Statistics,Linear Algebra,Matrix)
b)Model(Different ML models)
c)Training(For Optimize the ml model we need to do lot of tweeking and this is where calculus will help us)

 
4 subfilelds of ML:
a)Linear Algebra-Vectors and Matrix
b)Statistics - For understanding the data. For dtat analytics.
c)Probability - Likelihood of some decision. We will be getting output of ml model in probability.
d)Calculus - Differential and Integral calculus. Concept like Gradient Descent.
