Currently i am working on machine learning and deep learning models. Whatever i will be doing to learn machine learning , deep learning and python, i will post it on this repository. Contribute to my work for better learning process.....!

1)Starting with the journey of learning machine learning and deep learning, I have learned python library called NUMPY. 

  Checkout [here](https://github.com/KARTIKPARATKAR/MY-MACHINE-LEARNING-WORK/blob/b5a4bdcfde35d6e9461cb9a7113c5b04043e70ea/NUMPY%20LIBRARY) 

2)Pandas library for data manupulation and analysis.

Boston housing dataset [here](https://github.com/KARTIKPARATKAR/MY-MACHINE-LEARNING-WORK/blob/main/BostonHousing.csv).
  
3)Matplotlib library for for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

  Checkout [here](https://github.com/KARTIKPARATKAR/MY-MACHINE-LEARNING-WORK/blob/main/MATPLOTLIB.ipynb)

4)Seaborn library for high level interface for drawing attractive and informative ststistical graphics.
  
 Checkout [here](https://github.com/KARTIKPARATKAR/MY-MACHINE-LEARNING-WORK/blob/main/Seaborn.ipynb)

5)How to handle the missing values and how to use dropna and fillna function in machine learning is done here

  Chechout [here](https://github.com/KARTIKPARATKAR/MY-MACHINE-LEARNING-WORK/blob/main/HandlingMissingValues.ipynb)

6)This will tell you how can we standardize the data so as to feed it to the machine learning model.

7)Label Encoding is used to convert categorical column into numerical ones so as to feed it to the machine learning model.
