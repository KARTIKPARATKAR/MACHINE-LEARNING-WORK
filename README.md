Currently i am working on machine learning and deep learning models. Whatever i will be doing to learn machine learning , deep learning and python, i will post it on this repository. Contribute to my work for better learning process.....!

1)Starting with the journey of learning machine learning and deep learning, I have learned python library called NUMPY. 

  Checkout work done in NUMPY library [here](https://github.com/KARTIKPARATKAR/MY-MACHINE-LEARNING-WORK/blob/b5a4bdcfde35d6e9461cb9a7113c5b04043e70ea/NUMPY%20LIBRARY) 

2)Pandas library for data manupulation and analysis.
Checkout work done in Pandas [here](https://github.com/KARTIKPARATKAR/MY-MACHINE-LEARNING-WORK/blob/main/PANDAS.ipynb)
Boston housing dataset [here]().
  
3)Matplotlib library for for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
