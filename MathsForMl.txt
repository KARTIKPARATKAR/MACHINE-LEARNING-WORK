3 main piller of ML-
a)Data(Statistics,Linear Algebra,Matrix)
b)Model(Different ML models)
c)Training(For Optimize the ml model we need to do lot of tweeking and this is where calculus will help us)

 
4 subfilelds of ML:
a)Linear Algebra-Vectors and Matrix
b)Statistics - For understanding the data. For dtat analytics.
c)Probability - Likelihood of some decision. We will be getting output of ml model in probability.
d)Calculus - Differential and Integral calculus. Concept like Gradient Descent.


Vectors:
Physics Based Approch: Speed is scalar as we dont define direction when we tell speed to someone.
                       Velocity is vector as we define direction when we tell velocity to someone.

Mathematical Based Approach: Magnitude and Direction.
                             vector p = 3i^ + 2j^
                             Here 3 and 2 are magnitude and i^ and j^ are direction.

Computer Science Based Approach: We can represent vector in list as follows:
                                 p=[3,2](1 row 2 columns)   or p=[3
                                                                  2 ] (2 rows and 1 columns)
